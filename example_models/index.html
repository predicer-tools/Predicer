title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1> <h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a class=headerlink href=#introduction title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>This section contains a more detailed description of example models found in Predicer. The idea behind the example models is not to provide a detailed and correct ready-to-use model, but rather to explain concepts and ideas found in Predicer, and how it is implemented in the input data files. These concepts and ideas can then be used to build more complex models replicating real systems. It is recommended that this section is read while having the respective example model input data file for reference.</p> <p>Every aspect of every model is not discussed in detail, if concepts and ideas are described in previous models.</p> <h2 id=simple-building-model>Simple building model<a class=headerlink href=#simple-building-model title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>The input data file for the model can be found under <em>"/Predicer/input_data/simple_building_model.xlsx"</em>. The simple building model is a model of a simplified building with direct electric heating with spot-based electricity pricing. The energy balance of the modelled building consists of three major elements; heat loss from inside the building to the ambient air, and an electric heater to maintain the temperature of the inside air within a comfortable range. In addition an electric powered domestic hot water (DHW) tank is modelled as a storage, with the use of DHW being represented by a timeseries. The aim of the model is to minimize the electricity costs for the electric heater and the DHW heater by using the storage capacities of the building and the DHW tank to time the use of electricity to the cheapest hours. This should be done while maintaining the temperature of the building at a comfortable level and ensuring that the hot water tank doesn't empty at any point during the day.</p> <p>A real building could of course be modelled more accurately, adding concepts such as heat losses through ventilation, overall electricity use, effect of solar radiation, dividing the building into smaller nodes, etc. </p> <p>The model horizon for the simple building model is 9.0 hours with the timesteps being 15 minutes, for a total of 36 timesteps. There are three scenarios in the model (<em>s1</em>, <em>s2</em> and <em>s3</em>), and all of the data used in the model is randomly generated. </p> <h3 id=nodes-and-processes>Nodes and processes<a class=headerlink href=#nodes-and-processes title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>The model consists of five nodes: <em>interiorair</em> representing the air (and structures) inside the building, <em>buildingenvelope</em> representing the building components separating the inside from the outside, <em>outsideair</em> representing the ambient air, <em>dhw</em> representing the domestic hot water tank, and <em>elc</em> representing the local electricity grid the building is connected to. <em>npe</em> represents the electricity market from where electricity can be bought for a hourly varying price.</p> <p>There are two processes in the model: <em>electricheater</em> for converting electricity from the <em>elc</em> node to heat in the <em>interiorair</em> node, and <em>dhw_heater</em> converting electricity from the <em>elc</em> node to heat in the <em>dhw</em> node. Below is a simple schematic of the topology of the simple building model. </p> <pre class=mermaid><code>flowchart RL

The heat loss to the ambient air is modelled using the diffusion functionality found in Predicer. A diffusion flow can be defined between two nodes with states, with the states generally being modelled as temperature instead of energy. The size of the flow between two nodes in a diffusion relation is simply the difference between the states multiplied with a user-defined coefficient <strong><em>c</em></strong>. </p> <p><strong><em>P<sub>loss</sub> = c * (state<sub>1</sub> - state<sub>2</sub>)</em></strong></p> <p>The unit of the heat transfer coefficient <strong><em>c</em></strong> in this model case would be <em>kW/K</em>. The value of the diffusion coefficient is chosen to be 0.25 <em>(kW/K)</em> between the <em>interiorair</em> and <em>buildingenvelope</em> nodes and 0.2 <em>(kW/K)</em> between the <em>buildingenvelope</em> and <em>outside</em> nodes. The diffusion coefficient is provided as a timeseries, and can vary between the timesteps even if in this example it is constant. One use case for a timeseries-dependent diffusion could be a wind forecast, with higher wind speeds resulting in a higher heat loss.</p> <p>In the example Excel file, this is done on the <em>node_diffusion</em> sheet, where data is defined for each scenario and timestep for both diffusion relations. </p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>t</th> <th>interiorair,buildingenvelope,s1</th> <th>buildingenvelope,outside,s1</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>2022-01-05T08:00:00</td> <td>0.25</td> <td>0.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2022-01-05T08:15:00</td> <td>0.25</td> <td>0.2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>To be able to model heat loss, the <em>buildingenvelope</em>, <em>interiorair</em> and <em>outside</em> nodes are given states which represent the temperature in the respective nodes. This is done by setting the <em>is_state</em> and <em>is_temp</em> flags to <strong>True</strong>. </p> <p>Most of the flows in Predicer, such as process flows, diffusion flows, etc. are modelled as <em>energy</em>, not <em>temperature</em>. The conversion between energy and temperature for a state is defined in the <em>T_E_conversion</em> parameter. This parameter indicates how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the state by one (the unit depends on the model, in this case one Kelvin <em>K</em>). In the simple building model the energy is in the form of <em>kW/kWh</em>, and temperature in the form of <em>K</em>. The conversion rate is set to 0.5 <em>(kWh/K)</em> for the <em>interiorair</em> node and 1.0 <em>(kWh/K)</em> for the <em>buildingenvelope</em> node. If the heat losses were zero, this would mean that operating the electric heater at 1 kW for one hour would increase the temperature of the <em>interiorair</em> node by 2 K, which essentially would mean increasing the value of the storage (state) by 2. As the heat losses from the building are not expected to increase the temperature of the ambient air, the <em>T_E_conversion</em> parameter is set to 1 000 000 000 for the <em>outside</em> node. In the simple building model this means, that a cumulative heat flow of 10<sup>9</sup> kWh into the ambient air node is required to increase its storage state by 1 (<em>K</em>).</p> <p>The initial states of the <em>interiorair</em>, <em>buildingenvelope</em> and <em>outside</em> nodes are set to 292.15 K, 282.0 K and 269.5 K, respectively. The modelled system is approximately in balance on the first timestep when these values are used. </p> <p>As the heat loss in this model depends on the temperature difference between the building and the ambient air, it is important to be able to define the ambient air temperature properly. This can be done by setting the <em>is_inflow</em> flag of the <em>outside</em> node to <strong>True</strong>. This allows the hourly temperature changes of the ambient air to be given as an inflow timeseries to the node. So if the initial ambient temperature would be 263K, and the temperature for three first time steps would be 273K, 268K and 260K, the inflow timeseries to the ambient air node (<em>outside</em>) would be [+10, -5, -8] for the first three timesteps.</p> <p>As one of the objectives of this example model is to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the building, the boundaries of the comfortable temperature range must be defined. This can either be done using hard or soft boundaries. If hard boundaries are used, the temperature of the <em>interiorair</em> node is not allowed to go below or above the boundaries. This can be achieved either by setting the node parameters <em>state_min</em> and <em>state_max</em> to the desired temperature range, or by making user-defined gen_constraints with the <em>is_setpoint</em> flag set to false. </p> <p>Soft boundaries for the temperature range can be defined by making user-defined gen_constraints with the <em>is_setpoint</em> flag set to true. When a suitable cost (<em>penalty</em> parameter in the "constraints" sheet in the input data excel file) is set, the model can deviate from the given temperatue range, but this induces a cost for the model and is thus usually avoided. It is also possible to combine several layers of soft boundaries, with the cost of deviation increasing for each passed layer, and hard boundaries with soft boundaries, as long as the hard boundaries are less "strict" than the soft boundaries (e.g. hard boundary lower/upper limits of 15°C/27°C and soft boundery lower/upper limits of 19°C/24°C).</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>operator</th> <th>is_setpoint</th> <th>penalty</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>c_interiorair_up</td> <td>st</td> <td>1</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>c_interiorair_down</td> <td>gt</td> <td>1</td> <td>15</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>One set of soft boundaries are used in the example model, defined using the "c_interiorair_up" as upper limit and "c_interiorair_down" as lower limit gen_constraints.

This has to be done, while ensuring that the DHW never runs out. The storage is allowed to be empty momentarily, as long as there is enough to cover the demand at all times. </p> <p>The DHW system is modelled using a node <em>dhw</em> with a state (storage) and inflow (hot water use timeseries). The unit in <em>dhw</em> is thought to be <em>kWh</em>, to make it easier to model in this case. This means that the "water" in the DHW tank is represented by the amount of energy it would require to heat it from cold water, and the limits of the storage, as well as the inflow (use) of DHW uses this same unit. The storage losses of the DHW tank are not accounted for, as it is assumed that the heat is dissipated into the building, thus reducing the need to operate the electric space heater. The <em>state_loss-proportional</em> parameter is thus set to 0. </p> <p>The inflow data for the DHW system is randomly generated, with a small baseload and one or more larger spikes, representing 5-15 minute showers. The DHW demand can either be covered directly using the <em>dhw</em> heater, or by taking water from the hot water tank. The DHW demand is between 15 - 22 kWh over the modelled 9 hours, with the largest peak being 9.17 kWh over an timestep. This means that the <em>dhw_heater</em> (3 kW) is not enough to cover the demand at all timesteps. </p> <p>As Predicer doesn't consider what happens before or after the modelled time horizon, it is likely that the DHW tank would be empty after the last timestep, since any water left in the tank would be "wasted" from the perspective of the model. To amend this, a value for the water remaining in the tank can be defined. This value estimate is set to be the average hourly electricity price of the simple building model. This parameter is defined using the <em>state_residual_value</em> field in the input_data file on the <em>nodes</em> sheet.</p> <h2 id=simple-district-heating-system-model>Simple district heating system model<a class=headerlink href=#simple-district-heating-system-model title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>The input data file for the model can be found under <em>"/Predicer/input_data/simple_dh_model.xlsx"</em>. The simple district heating model is a model of a simple district heating system, operated by a single actor. The idea behind the system is to minimize the costs (or maximize the profits) while covering an hourly heat demand, and operating on an electricity spot market. The heat demand is defined as a time series, and the system has to cover the demand at all times. Several different heat generation units in combination with a heat day storage provides flexibility, which can be utilized to minimize the costs of covering the demand. The price of the provided heat is not defined (also 0), as is usual for local DH system modelling. The costs of the modelled system thus consist of fuel and operational costs for generating the required heat, and profits come from electricity sold to the spot market.</p> <p>The model only considers heat balances on a system production level, and building-specific balances are not considered.

These costs include fuel costs (natural gas, electricity), electricity transmission costs, carbon emission permits, as well as emission taxes for carbon and electricity. The fuel cost of natural gas is defined as a timeseries on the <em>price</em> sheet in the input data, with a value of 25.0 (<em>€/MWh</em>) for every hour. The cost of electricity, both when buying and selling is defined as a timeseries in the <em>market_prices</em> sheet in the input data. The prices are randomly generated, and vary between 2.13-85.38 (<em>€/MWh</em>), with an average price of 42.92 (<em>€/MWh</em>). </p> <p>The sum of the carbon emission permits and carbon tax amount to 22.0 (<em>€</em>) per MWh of natural gas used. As these costs depend on the use of natural gas from the <em>ng</em> node, the VOM (variable operation and maintenance) cost of the natural gas flow for the <em>ngchp</em> process in the <em>process_topologies</em> sheet is set to 22.0. This causes a cost of 22.0 for each unit (<em>MWh</em>) of <em>ng</em> that is used by the <em>ngchp</em> process. In this example model case these costs could also have been directly added to the price of natural gas, as the <em>ngchp</em> process is the sole consumer of natural gas. Another way to implement carbon permits or taxes (<em>€/ton</em>) would be to add a "emissions" flow to relevant processes and to add the costs to the VOM of this flow. To ensure this works properly, a <em>gen_constraint</em> has to be created to fix the size of the emission flow proportional to the size of the natural gas flow into the process. Additionally, the efficiency of the process has to be adjusted to include the emissions. A third way would be to create a commodity node <em>carbon_permits_and_taxes</em>, from where there would be a flow to a process using natural gas. In this case a <em>gen_constraint</em> fixing the ratio between natural gas and "emissions" would be needed as well. The emission costs can be set as the price of the commodity node. </p> <p>The sum of electricity tax and distribution costs is assumed to be 15.0 (<em>€/MWh</em>), and is added to each topology where electricity is consumed, except when buying from the market node. In this model this means the <em>elc</em> flows of the heat pumps and the <em>elc</em> flow of the <em>elc_boiler</em>.

The market prices for different scenarios for each timestep is used as a basis for the bidding curves.

A value of 1,57 (MW) for available heat would mean, that the amount of electricity is equal (1.57 MW) and the total heat output would be 3.14 MW. </p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>t</th> <th>heat_pump,hp_source,s1</th> <th>heat_pump,hp_source,s2</th> <th>heat_pump,hp_source,s3</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>16.4.2024 0:00</td> <td>1,57</td> <td>2,35</td> <td>2,50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16.4.2024 1:00</td> <td>1,62</td> <td>2,45</td> <td>2,55</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16.4.2024 2:00</td> <td>1,62</td> <td>2,55</td> <td>2,45</td> </tr> <tr> <td>...</td> <td>...</td> <td>...</td> <td>...</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Like the <em>ngchp</em> process, the ratio of the incoming flows should be fixed.

The storage is defined in the node <em>heat_storage</em>, and it is connected to the <em>heat</em> node via the processes <em>heat_sto_charge</em> and <em>heat_sto_discharge</em>. The capacity of the storage is set to 10.0 (<em>MWh</em>), with the maximum flows in and out of the storage each being 3.0 (<em>MW</em>). As the system heat demand varies between 7-15 (<em>MW</em>), the storage alone cannot be used to generate heat into the system. The storage losses are 0.001 of the storage value per hour, and the starting value of the storage is set to 0.0. </p> <p>Optimization models commonly empty storages by the end of the model horizon, as any storage content is "wasted" from the model perspective. To prevent this, a value for heat remaining in the storage at the end of the model horizon is defined. The chosen value should represent the expected costs of heat production in the "next" horizon.</p> <h2 id=two-stage-model>Two stage model<a class=headerlink href=#two-stage-model title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>The two stage dh model is an extension of the simple district heating model described above. The model is defined in the "two_stage_dh_model.xlsx" input data file. The extension consists of a simple two stage modelling implementation, with a first stage where the price of the market <em>npe</em> and all other timeseries parameters are known and identical for all scenarios (<em>s1</em>, <em>s2</em>, <em>s3</em>). After the common start, the scenarios branch out into separate forecasts in the second stage. The lengths of the first and second stages are 12 timesteps (12 hours) each. The two stage approach is defined in the <em>setup</em> sheet, with setting the <em>common_timesteps</em> parameter to 12, and the <em>common_scenario_name</em> parameter to "ALL". This leads to all variable indices to have the scenario name <em>ALL</em> for the first 12 timesteps, instead of the standard scenario names. </p> <p>All of the scenario-dependent timeseries parameters are set to be identical between the scenarios for each timestep for the first 12 timesteps. In this case this means the <em>inflow</em>, <em>cf</em>, <em>(price)</em>, <em>market_prices</em>, <em>balance_prices</em>, <em>eff_ts</em>, <em>cap_ts</em>, and <em>constraint</em> timeseries. After the model has been optimized, the values for the variables for the first 12 timesteps are the same in all scenarios, after which they start to branch out. </p> <h2 id=simple-hydropower-river-system>Simple hydropower river system<a class=headerlink href=#simple-hydropower-river-system title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>The input data file for the example model can be found under "simple_hydropower_river_system.xlsx". This example model consists of a hydropower river system with five hydropower plants connected by a river. Each hydropower plant contains a reservoir, where water can be stored for optimal use timing. Each reservoir has a inflow of water from smaller rivers or rainfall Each hydropower plant also contains a turbine by-pass, which can be used to release water from the reservoir to the river without producing electricity. The model contains a delay between the hydropower plant, meaning it takes a while for the released water to reach the next plant. </p> <p>The goal of the model is to maimize the profits on the linked electricity markets by optimizing the use of the water in the reservoirs as well as possible. The system is constrained by minimum and maximum flow requirements for the river, as well as minimum and maximum water levels in the reservoirs. The model contains three scenarios <em>"dry"</em>, <em>"normal"</em> and <em>"wet"</em>, with differing electricity market prices and inflow to the reservoirs. The scenario <em>"dry"</em> contains a lower inflow into the reservoirs and resulting higher electricity prices. The scenario <em>"wet"</em> containts a higher inflow into the reservoirs and lower electricity prices, while the scenario <em>"medium"</em> lies somewhere in between <em>"dry"</em> and *"wet"*in regards to inflow and electricity prices. </p> <p>The depicted system is fictional, and all timeseries data (inflows, market prices, etc.) is randomly generated, with some modifications. The time horizon for the model is 30 days, with the first two days being modelled in higher resolution with one hour timesteps, the following two days modelled with 4 hour timesteps, and the rest being modelled with one day timesteps. </p> <h3 id=nodes-and-processes_2>Nodes and processes<a class=headerlink href=#nodes-and-processes_2 title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>There are five hydropower plants (processes) in the model <em>hydro1</em>, <em>hydro2</em>, <em>hydro3</em>, <em>hydro4</em> and <em>hydro5</em>, representing hydropower turbines. All of these processes have a linked node; <em>res1</em>, <em>res2</em>, <em>res3</em>, <em>res4</em> and <em>res5</em>, respectively. Each plant also has a linked spill process <em>hydro1_spill</em>, <em>hydro2_spill</em>, <em>hydro3_spill</em>, <em>hydro4_spill</em>, and <em>hydro5_spill</em>, which can be used to release water from the linked reservoir without producing electricity. A simple schematic of the river system can be seen in the figure below. The reservoirs linked to the processes <em>hydro1</em> and <em>hydro2</em> do not have an "upstream" connection, and the processes both connect with the reservoir linked with <em>hydro3</em>. The process <em>hydro3</em> is upstream of <em>hydro4</em>, which is upstream of <em>hydro5</em>. The process <em>hydro5</em> doesn't have a downstream node, and it could be thought that this is where the river system flows out to the sea. The modellled system also has an electricity node <em>elc</em>, which is linked to electricity energy and reserve markets. Each of the hydropower plants has a connection to the <em>elc</em> node. </p> <pre class=mermaid><code>flowchart TD

</code></pre> <p>The reservoir nodes (both inflows and flows) are modelled as water (<em>m<sup>3</sup></em>). As the flows are large, the unit of one water is assumed to be 1000 m<sup>3</sup> instead of 1 m<sup>3</sup>. This reduces scaling issues in the model as well. The amount of energy available in the water can be calculated using the potential energy of the water, and assuming some losses in the conversion process. The process electrical generation ber unit of water (1000 m<sup>3</sup>), the corresponding process (electrical) efficiency p, as well as reservoir and flow limitations are shown in the table below.
